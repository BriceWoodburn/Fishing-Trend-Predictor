# CastIQ
A full-stack fishing analytics and tracking web application designed to log, analyze, and visualize fishing data.

## Overview
CastIQ allows users to record, view, and analyze their fishing catches through organized tables and data visualizations. The goal is to help anglers uncover patterns such as bait performance, species frequency, and seasonal trends that they wouldnt otherwise have noticed. CastIQ offers a clean, user-friendly, and fully responsive interface.

## Features
- Log detailed catch data, including date, time, location, species, length, weight, water temperature, and bait.
- Explore insightful data visualizations for:
  - **Species Frequency Chart:** Shows which fish species are caught most often.
  - **Catch History Chart:** Displays catches over time to reveal active fishing periods or seasonal patterns.
  - **Bait Effectiveness Chart:** Compares how well different baits perform based on total catches.
  - **Average Weight and Length Charts:** Displays the average weight and length for each species caught. 
- Search and filter catches with a dynamic search bar.
- Fully responsive, intuitive design for desktop and mobile.

## Motivation
I created CastIQ to combine two things I love, fishing and software development. Fishing has always been one of my favorite pastimes, though I’ll admit I’m not very good. This project not only helps me analyze my catches and learn from past results, but it also gave me the opportunity to deepen my understanding of backend development, database design, and full-stack integration. I’m always looking for ways to learn, and this project was a fun way to grow as a software developer, and build something useful.
